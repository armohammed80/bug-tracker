# Bug Tracker Project

#### Video Demo: https://your-video-url-here.com

#### Description:

The project is a web-based bug tracking system developed with Django, designed to help software development teams efficiently report, manage, and resolve bugs throughout their projects. It supports multiple organizations and projects, with user roles such as Developer and Testerâ€”each assigned specific permissions to ensure secure and appropriate access.

Key features include the ability to create detailed bug reports with severity levels, update bug statuses dynamically, assign bugs to developers, and foster team collaboration through comments. The interface uses Bootstrap to provide a clean, responsive, and user-friendly experience.

This project not only solves the real-world problem of bug management but also demonstrates a strong grasp of web development principles like user authentication, role-based permissions, form handling, and UI design. The system can be further customized and extended, serving as a foeundation for more comprehensive bug tracking solutions.
